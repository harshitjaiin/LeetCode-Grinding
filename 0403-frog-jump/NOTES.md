In this question basically from the zero at index, bigger only have a jump of one. So first thing to notice here is that if difference between the elements at 1st position and zero position is not equal to one, then there is no way we can reach the end so ans is false.
​
Now if we can reach the index one, then just explore all the three possibilities from the particular index. For example, in the given example when we move to the first index, we have 2 options only, since we cannot move backwards or at the same position. We only have to move forward.
​
In that case, if the previous jump size of 1 then we cannot have the case where we move previous one, because in that case it would just end up staying there only. Other than that, the other two cases we have to explore. The 1st case , if we have previously taken a jump of 1 then now also we pick a jump of one. But as we can see in this given example, if we take a jump of 1 from the element at the 1st position, which is 1 then 1 plus 1 gives us 2. But there is no stone which has a number of 2. Therefore we won't be able to go there .So how we check that if a particular stone exists or not? For that, we use a hash map which tells us what number of stone is present at what index Similarly, we can also have an option that we can take a jump of previous one, which is, in this case, true. So we'll take a jump of 2 from index I, and we reach index number of two. And similarly, we can do the solution
